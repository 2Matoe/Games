Games including AI games, fetch.ai, etc.
2Matoe , https://2matoe.com is trying to learn how to primarily use fetch.ai to create games.  We created a tic tac toe game and would like to create more using fetch.ai only.   Then we would like to work on other projects.  2Matoe is open to developers contacting us.   You may use our code and game but must pay a license fee if utilizing it commercially (to be negotiated) AND 2Matoe retains ownership and receives credit "licensed from 2Matoe" etc.
We have some good ideas and welcome others.  Please contact 2Matoe at info@2matoe.com with the subject "Games" to present your ideas, collaboration, etc.   We are willing to provide payments where mutually beneficial, and other discussions.
Thank you and have a good day.
